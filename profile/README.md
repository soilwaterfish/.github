# Open Science Development - Soil - Water - Fisheries

This is a organization for housing all language agnostic open source gis and data packages.

## Repo guidelines:

We're pretty much using the [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)

1. All work ***MUST*** happen on branches. 
2. Make sure your pull requests merge onto `dev` and not `main`.
3. Hotfixes may be applied directly to `main`... carefully and after lots of testing.
4. Add your issue and/or pull request to a milestone to make sure it will be included.
5. Attach your commits to issues and pull requests by [referencing them in commit messages](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/github/managing-your-work-on-github/closing-issues-using-keywords)
