# Open Science Development - Soil - Water - Fisheries

This is a organization for housing all language agnostic open source gis and data packages, tools, etc.  

It is meant to help practitioners get involved with development, communication, and collobartion in a natural resource context. 

This is a Free and Open Source Software repository. Everything you see here is meant to be open source. With that being said, if you have private information that you can't share and you share, that's on you!  

## Repo guidelines:

We're pretty much using the [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)

1. All work ***MUST*** happen on branches. 
2. Make sure your pull requests merge onto `dev` and not `main`.
3. Hotfixes may be applied directly to `main`... carefully and after lots of testing.
4. Add your issue and/or pull request to a milestone to make sure it will be included.
5. Attach your commits to issues and pull requests by [referencing them in commit messages](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/github/managing-your-work-on-github/closing-issues-using-keywords)
